# ARRC-Fixed-Wing-

## 1.0 Introduction  
The following is my work in designing a fixed wing aircraft in UBCO's Aeronotica Robotics and Rocketry Club (ARRC). I am responsible for designing the aircraft's fusalage, however, i also worked on the airfoil analysis. I will talk through my xflr5 analysis and the different iterations i made for the aircraft fusalage.
